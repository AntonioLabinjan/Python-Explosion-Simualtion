# Python-Explosion-Simualtion

This Python project represents a simulation of an explosion's propagation in a two-dimensional grid. The project demonstrates how the propagation of an explosion can be modeled and visualized using simple physics principles.


## How does the simulation work?

The project utilizes a two-dimensional grid of particles. The explosion is initialized at the center of the grid and then propagates over a series of simulation steps. Each step calculates an explosion propagation factor based on the distance from the center, resulting in an animation of the explosion's spread, visualized using Matplotlib.

## Simulation Parameters

- `grid_size`: Size of the grid.
- `explosion_radius`: Explosion radius (in meters).
- `explosion_strength`: Explosion strength (in energy units).
- `num_frames`: Number of frames in the animation.

## How to use the project?

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install the required Python libraries, including Matplotlib.
3. Run the `explosion_simulation.py` script.
4. Watch the explosion propagation animation on your screen.

## Customizing the Simulation

You can adjust the simulation parameters (explosion radius, strength, number of frames) to experiment with different explosion scenarios.
